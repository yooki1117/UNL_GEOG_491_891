# GEOG 491/891: Special Topics - Spatial Analysis in R

## 

## Week 7.02: summaries, spatial joins, and the practical effects of topological relations 

### Dr. Bitterman

## 

---

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Spatial data operations
- For next class

---

## Anything to discuss? Questions?


---

# today's setup

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```
### **new data in the repository**

---

# A story from my Vermont research

- Nutrient runoff (primarily phosphorus) causes harmful cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Champlain
- TMDL regulations "limit" the amount of criteria pollutants allowed to enter waterbodies that flow to the Lake
- To regulate, and to improve, we need to measure
- So EPA has broken-down the Lake Champlain Basin into units of analysis called **NHDPlus segments**

---

# But management is a different issue

- We don't commonly manage water-related problems using watershed-dervied jurisdictions
- We should, but we don't
- In Vermont, they'd doing something a bit different
- Tactical Basins, CWSPs, and RPCs

---

# Let's estimate the load in each RPC

---

# Start with the NHDs

```r
# NHDs
nhds <- sf::read_sf("./data/nhdplus_loads.shp") %>% sf::st_make_valid()
glimpse(nhds)
tm_shape(nhds) + tm_polygons("Baseline_L", n = 10)
```
### ```Baseline_L``` is phosphorus load in kg/year

---

# And now the RPCs

```r
# RPCs
rpcs <- sf::read_sf("./data/gn_vt_rpcs.shp") %>% sf::st_make_valid()
glimpse(rpcs) 
tm_shape(rpcs) + tm_polygons(col = "INITIALS")
```

---

# Overlay them

```r
tm_shape(rpcs) + tm_borders(col = "red") +
  tm_shape(nhds) + tm_polygons(col = "Baseline_L", n = 7) +
  tm_shape(rpcs) + tm_borders(col = "red")
```
### Why am I calling `tm_shape(rpcs)` twice? Any ideas?

---

# Our objective:

### Calculate the total phosphorus load in each RPC

### Ideas for how to accomplish that task?

---

# A spatial join

```r
# do the join
nhd_rpcs <- st_join(nhds, rpcs, join = st_intersects)

# look at it/confirm it worked
glimpse(nhd_rpcs)

# plot it
tm_shape(nhd_rpcs) + tm_polygons(col = "RPC")
```

---
# and now to summarize...

### Suggestions?

---
# The "tidy way"

```r
# the "tidy way"
nhd_rpcs %>% 
  group_by(RPC) %>% 
  summarize(totalLoad = sum(Baseline_L))
```
### What was the output?

---

# Add a line to plot it

```r
nhd_rpcs %>% 
  group_by(RPC) %>% 
  summarize(totalLoad = sum(Baseline_L)) %>%
  tm_shape(.) + tm_polygons(col = "totalLoad") # <- this line is new
```
### the utility of pipes

---

# An alternative method

### from your book...

- works a bit differently
- uses ```sf``` features to do the aggreation
```r
# using aggregate instead
aggregate(x = nhds, by = rpcs, FUN = sum) # throws an error... what's the problem?
```

### Error message:

```r
Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...) : invalid 'type' (character) of argument
```
### What's the problem?

---

# Fixing the problem

```r
glimpse(nhds) # How many character attribues?

# fix the problem
nhds %>% dplyr::select(-SOURCEFC, -NHDPlus_Ca, -Tactical_B) %>%
  aggregate(x = ., by = rpcs, FUN = sum)
```

---

# Do it again, but assign it to a variable

```r
# same function, but assign it to a variable
agg.rpcs <- nhds %>% dplyr::select(-SOURCEFC, -NHDPlus_Ca, -Tactical_B) %>%
  aggregate(x = ., by = rpcs, FUN = sum)
```

### Plot it
```r
# plot it... why and how is it different?
tm_shape(agg.rpcs) + tm_polygons(col = "Baseline_L"
```
**how/why is it different than our earlier plot?**

---

# So, have we completed our task?

### Any remaining issues?

---

# Let's check our spatial relationships

### Break down the code
```r
# issues with overlap
nhd_rpcs %>% group_by(NHDPlus_ID) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

### What's the result?

---

# Area-weighted interpolation
**(to the whiteboard!)**

```r
# area-weighted interpolation
interp.loads <- nhds %>% dplyr::select(Baseline_L, geometry) %>% 
  st_interpolate_aw(., rpcs, extensive = T)

tm_shape(interp.loads) + tm_polygons(col = "Baseline_L")
```

### Same? Different? How can we compare?

---

# Do a join
**(note, I'm cheating a bit here and relying on the RPC geometry being identical)**

```r
# do a join 
comparison <- st_join(agg.rpcs, interp.loads, st_equals)

# calculate the error, then map it
tmap_mode("view")

comparison %>% mutate(diff = Baseline_L.x - Baseline_L.y) %>%
  tm_shape(.) + tm_polygons(col = "diff") +
  tm_shape(nhds) + tm_borders(col = "blue")
```
### How different were the methods?

---

# If there's time, return to the code reading activity...
