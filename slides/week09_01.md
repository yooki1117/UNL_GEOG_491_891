# This week's plan

- Today: lecture on formalizing space (it may look familiar to some of you)
- Friday: lab that builds on lecture and demonstrates how to calculate spatial autocorrelation in R

---


# Today is about formalization

* Why?
* But also, WHY???
* Formalizing spatial relationships is foundational
    * "Global" spatial autocorrelation
    * Local spatial autocorrelation metrics
    * Spatial clustering
    * Hot spots/cold spots

---

# Tobler's first law of Geography

* Everything is related to everything else, but nearer things are more related than farther (or something like that)

* Formally, *spatial autocorrelation*

---

## Spatial autocorrelation of areal units (% white, 2010 Census)

---

# Relevant questions

- Which areas are important?
- Which areas are unusual?
- Are there “hotspots” of some phenomena?
- How much influence do neighbors have?
- How should we measure/ conceptualize “neighbors”?
- Implications of our choices?


---

# Spatial context matters

- For a statistical method to be explicitly spatial, it needs to contain some representation of the geography, or spatial context

- One of the most common ways is through *spatial weights matrices*

---

# Formalizing processes

- **(Geo)Visualization**: translating numbers into a (visual) language that the human brain “speaks better”

- **Spatial Weights Matrices**: translating geography into a (numerical) language that a computer “speaks better”

---

# Spatial weights matrices

Core element in several spatial analysis techniques:

- Spatial autocorrelation
- Spatial clustering / geodemographics 
- Spatial regression

---

# Formalization

*W* as a formal representation of space

---

# *W* (the spatial weights matrix)

- *N x N positive matrix* that contains **spatial relations** between all the observations in the sample 

- FORMALLY, w<sub>ij</sub>... the weight from zone *i* to zone *j*

- Core concept in statistical analysis of areal data

- Two steps involved:
    - define which relationships between observations are to be given a nonzero weight, i.e., define spatial neighbors
    - assign weights to the neighbors

*w<sub>ii</sub>* = 0 (by convention)

### *...what is a neighbor?*

---

# How would you define a "neighbor"?

- Making the neighbors and weights is not easy as it seems to be

- Which states are near Nebraska?

---

# What IS a neighbor?

A neighbor is “somebody” who is:
- Next door → **Contiguity**-based Ws
- Close → **Distance**-based Ws


---

# Spatial neighbors

### Contiguity-based neighbors

- Zone i and j are neighbors if zone i is contiguity or adjacent to zone j
- But what constitutes contiguity?

### Distance-based neighbors

- Zone i and j are neighbors if the distance between them are less than the threshold distance
- But what distance do we use?

---

# Choice of W

- Should be based on and reflect the underlying channels of interaction for the question at hand. Examples:
    - Processes propagated by inmediate contact (e.g. disease contagion) → Contiguity weights 
    - Accessibility → Distance weights
    - Effects of county differences in laws → Block weights

---

# Contiguity-based Spatial Neighbors

![contiguity neighbors](./images/contiguity_neighbors.png)

---

# Example

![contiguity nets](./images/contiguity_nets.png)

---

# Higher-order contiguity

![higher order](./images/higher_order_contiguity.png)

---

# Distance-based neighbors

- How do we measure distance between polygons?
- Distance metrics
    - 2D Cartesian distance (projected data)
    - 3D spherical distance/great-circle distance (lat/long data)

- *But where do we measure from?*
- *Any implications of our choices?*


---

# Distance-based neighbors (k-nearest)

![k nearest](./images/k_nearest.png)

---

# Distance-based neighbors (threshold distance)

![distance-based](./images/distance_nearest.png)


---

# A simple spatial weights matrix

![simple weights matrix](./images/simple_weights_matrix.png)

---

# Decay functions of distance

- Most common choice is the inverse (reciprocal) of the distance between locations i and j 
- Other functions also used
    - inverse of squared distance 
    - Or negative exponential 


---


# Standardization

- In some applications (e.g. spatial autocorrelation) it is common to standardize W
- The most widely used standardization is row-based: divide every element by the sum of the row

---


# Contiguity

- Common boundaries: if two polygons share boundaries to some degree, they will be labeled as neighbors under these kinds of weights
    - **Queen**: only need to share a vertex (a common POINT)
    - **Rook**: share a vertex AND a line segment
- Depending on the level of irregularity, queen and rooks contiguity may be *very* similar (if not identical)


---

# Spatial lag (can be confusing)

### *Formally...*

The product of a spatial weights matrix *W* and a given variable *y*

Wy<sub>i</sub> = $\sum$ w<sub>ij</sub>y<sub>ij</sub>

---

# more generally:

- Measure that captures the behaviour of a variable in the neighborhood of a given observation *i*

- If *W* is standardized, the spatial lag is the average value of the variable in the neighborhood of *i*

- Common notation: the spatial lag of *y* is expressed as *W<sub>y</sub>*

- With a neighbor structure defined by the non-zero elements of the spatial weights matrix W, a spatially lagged variable is a weighted sum or a weighted average of the neighboring values for that variable


---

# Back to the formalization

The product of a spatial weights matrix *W* and a given variable *y*

Wy<sub>i</sub> = $\sum$ w<sub>ij</sub>y<sub>ij</sub>


---

# Moran plot

A standardized Moran Plot also partitions the space into four quadrants that represent different situations:

1. High-High (HH): high values above average surrounded by values above average

2. Low-Low (LL): low values below average surrounded by values below average

3. High-Low (HL): high values above average surrounded by values below average

4. Low-High (LH): low values below average surrounded by values above average

---

# More about Moran

- A standardized Moran Plot implies that average values are centered in the plot (as they are zero when standardized) and dispersion is expressed in standard deviations

- General rule: values greater or smaller than two standard deviations are considered *outliers*
