# This week's activity

- You all read (or should have) Chapter 5 from Lovelace (https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/geometric-operations.html)
- Instead of me providing you with a step-by-step walkthrough of the readings, **you're** going to do the teaching
- A quasi-"flipped classroom"

---

# Today's "spin"

- Work on your topics/plans until 3
- Then, we'll give a brief (5 min/each) overview of:
  - Your topic
  - Learning objectives
  - Your instructional technique
  - How you're checking for learning
  - What you learned, challenges
- We are NOT doing the instruction today

---

# What to do

- Form small groups (I've assigned the groups)
- Each group will be assigned a topic (or topics) from this week's readings
- Your tasks:
  - Develop a short lesson demonstrating the method(s)
  - Include:
    1. Learning objectives (what students will learn)
    2. Why the concepts/methods are important/relevant
    3. How a student would accomplish the task(s)
    4. A way to check for learning (and teaching != learning)

### All relevant resources can be found in the Lovelace chapter, but use what you think is relevant

---

# What you can use

- Anything
  - Web resources
  - Sample data
  - Whatever format you want (e.g., PowerPoint, R Markdown, something else)

## For this week

- Wildcard Friday is no-class Friday
- Monday/Tuesday are fall break
- Chapter 8 from your textbook
- Practice, practice, practice
- Lab 02 due Friday
