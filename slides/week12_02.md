# Today continues our experimental theme...
- Everyone has reviewed the readings/walkthrough for this week (https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
- Today, we will...
  1. break into teams
  2. complete tasks using Leaflet
  3. present (informally) your results, methods, challenges, etc. (maybe on Friday)

---

# Group 1 (Uzma, Kun-Yuan, Andy)

- Make a choropleth map of the population density of Nebraska Counties. There should be no more than 7 classes
- When the user "mouses over" a polygon, they should highlight, and a pop-up with the county name and population density should appear
- Place a legend in the bottom-right corner

### Challenges: 
1. Add a minimap to the interface
2. Add a "locate me" button to the interface

---

# Group 2 (Iksoon, Jason, Kidus, Bailey)

- Make a map of the monitoring stations and removed dams in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed
- The monitoring stations should be symbolized as a filled, semi-transparent circle with the size scaled to the Drainage Area of the station
- Dam layer should be shaded by the year it was removed
- Add controls to turn individual layers on and off

### Challenges: 
1. Use a custom icon for the dam layer
2. Add a control to the interface to change the base map
