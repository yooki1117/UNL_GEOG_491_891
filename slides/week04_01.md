## Week 04.01: Writing functions and reproducible code

### Dr. Bitterman

## 

---

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Lab 1 check-in
- Building blocks of reproducible code

---

## Anything to discuss? Questions?

---

# What makes our code "reproducible"?

---

# We've made some big leaps, but we haven't established a formalized vocabulary just yet

---

# Let's start with indexing our vectors

```r
library(tidyverse)

### daily rainfall in inches of rain
rainfall <- c(0.0, 2.1, 2.5, .1, 0.0, 0.0, 6.8, 3.1, 2.2)
```
### How do we gt the first element?

---

# Indexing

```r
# find the first element

rainfall[1]

```
### Let's assume a "big" storm is one with 3" or more in a day... how do we check?

---

# A simple logical test

```r
# a VERY big storm is one 3" or greater, so let's check

rainfall[1] >= 3
```
### what outputs are we limited to?

---

# A simple if-else block

```r
# Let's make an if-else block
if(rainfall[1] >= 3){
  print("big storm")
} else{
  print("little storm")
}
```
### limitations of this method?

### how does it generalize across the dataset?


---

# Let's first wrap the if-else block in a function and replace the variables

```r
f.storm.test <- function(rainfallAmount){
  if(rainfallAmount >= 3){
    print("big storm")
  } else{
    print("little storm")
  }
}
```
### what does this code do?
### Once you write a function, how do you use it?

---

# A function with a loop

```r
f.storm.test <- function(rainfallAmount){
  if(rainfallAmount >= 3){
    print("big storm")
  } else{
    print("little storm")
  }
}

for(i in rainfall){
  f.storm.test(i)
}
```

---

# A note on loops

- R loops are inefficient
- Instead of appending the output of a loop to a dataset...
- they make a complete new copy
- So use them in small cases, not large ones

---

# the `purrr::map` function is powerful, but confusing at times

### the "tidy way"
```r
rainfall %>% purrr::map(., f.storm.test)
```
### How did your output differ?

---

# There's also the good 'ol vectorized way of doing things

```r
rainfall >= 3
```

---

# if-else blocks vs. ifelse

```r
if(sometest){
  do something in here
}else{
  do something else here
}
```
### vs
```r
ifelse(sometest, do something, do something else)
```
...functionally equivalent, really up to you


---

# Finding the greatest rainfall day

### Ideas?

---

# A simple way

```r
max(rainfall)
```
### But which day is that?

---

# The `which` command can be useful

### Let's breakdown a weird syntax first...
```r
which(rainfall == max(rainfall))
```
### What happened?

---

# A tidy way of working with data.frames

```
mydf <- read_csv("./data/ne_counties.csv")
glimpse(mydf)
```

---

# Find the maximum median housing value

```r
max(mydf$MedValHous)
```

---

# Which works the same way, but not super useful

```r
which(mydf$MedValHous == max(mydf$MedValHous))
```
### what's the output - and what does it mean?

---

# Let's make it a bit more confusing

### Break it down step-by-step
```r
which(mydf$MedValHous == max(mydf$MedValHous)) %>% mydf[.,]
```
### How exactly does this work?

---

# A contrived question

### for each county, calculate how much its median housing value is LESS than the max value in the dataset

# 

### Thoughts?

---

# Easier than you'd think


### Break it down

```r
newdf <- mydf %>% mutate(deviation = MedValHous - max(MedValHous))
```

---

# plot it

```r
newdf %>% ggplot(., aes(x = deviation)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Review and next class

- Any questions?

- This weekâ€™s readings/tasks: 
  - Chapter 4 in textbook
  - Practice, practice, practice
  - Keep working on Lab 1

- IDEAS FOR OUR WILDCARD FRIDAY?
