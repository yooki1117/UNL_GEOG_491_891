## Week 6.02: A wild card Friday

### Dr. Bitterman

##

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Explanation
- Activity

---

## Anything to discuss? Questions?

---

# A slight reorganization

- Next week, we're going to focus on spatial operations and ontological theory/applications
- Reading is from an external source (see link)

---

# Processing a raster

- So far, we've worked through processing our HAB raster CONCEPTUALLY
- Thoughts on the exercise?

---

# It's important that our code be readable, reproducible

- In group/collaborative settings, you'll have to read the code of others
- So today, you'll read some of MY code
- It's a few years old, so be generous :)

# Your task

- In the "/src" directory of the course repo, find the "code_reading_ex.R" file
- I've stripped most of the comments from the document
- Your tasks...
    1. look at the code (and comments) to understand the "flow" of the code
    2. then, go through the code, line-by-line
    3. think about what the code is doing, then test it
    4. fill in the comments (behind the "#") with what the code does

- You can run it at any time up to any step
- I'm assigning teams

## For next week

- Chapters 4 here: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html 
- Practice, practice, practice
- Lab 02 - keep working
