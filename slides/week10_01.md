# Raster data structure review

1. What's a raster dataset?
2. How are they used?
3. What are the key properties of a raster?
4. Any other concerns (e.g., toppolgy) that you're aware of?

---

# Today's setup

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(raster)
library(tmap)
```
## What do you notice when you load these packages?


---

# Let's read a raster image

```r
myras <- raster::raster("./data/ts_2016.1007_1013.L4.LCHMP3.CIcyano.MAXIMUM_7day.tif")
```

## Plot it

```r
plot(myras)
```

---

# Basic properties

```r
# properties
myras

raster::extent(myras)
raster::nbands(myras)
```

---

# What's the data structure of a raster?


---

# Getting the value by index

```r
#[index]
myras[1]

myras[31225]
```


---

# Or by row, column

```r
#[row, column]  
myras[600, 175]
```

### Two questions:

1. How is "single indexing" different than row, column indexing?
2. For row, column indexing, what other information is useful/required to know what you're doing?

---

# Frequency of values

```r
raster::freq(myras)
```
### what's the output?

---

# Let's use it to make a quick histogram

### Who wants to break down this code function-by-function, parameter-by-parmeter?
```r
# quick histogram
myras %>% raster::freq() %>% data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = value, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

### Was the plot useful? Why/why not?

---

# Let's try again

```r
# filter out the 252 (no data) values
myras %>% raster::freq() %>% data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::filter(value < 252) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = value, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

### Better?

---

# Another way to "get" cell values

```r
# get all the values
myras %>% raster::values()
```

---

# Raster aggregation

### Why might we want to change the resolution of a raster?

### Break it down
```r
raster::aggregate(myras, 2, fun = max)
```
### What happened?

---

# More obvious comparisions

```r
raster::aggregate(myras, 2, fun = max) %>% plot()
raster::aggregate(myras, 5, fun = max) %>% plot()
```

---

# Different functions --> different results

```r
raster::aggregate(myras, 5, fun = max) %>% plot()
raster::aggregate(myras, 5, fun = mean) %>% plot()
```

---

# Data conversions

---

# Turning cells into points

```r
myras %>% raster::rasterToPoints()
```
### What's the data structure returned?

---

# We can also vectorize/polygon-ize

### Break it down again - what do we expect the output to be?
```r
# vectorize
poly1 <- rasterToPolygons(myras, dissolve = T)

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(poly1) + tm_polygons()
```
### What was the result?
