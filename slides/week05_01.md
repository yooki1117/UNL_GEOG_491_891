# GEOG 491/891: Special Topics - Spatial Analysis in R

## 

## Week 05.01: R as a GIS

### Dr. Bitterman

## 

---

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Some basic spatial operations
- Activity

---

## Anything to discuss? Questions?

---

# This week is SUPPOSED to be "point pattern analysis", but we're going to be flexible 

### (Chapters 5 & 6 are extensive)

### This week's focus: simple geospatial operations and getting comfortable with them

---


# today's setup

- there's new data in the ```./data/``` directory of the repository

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(GISTools)
library(tmap)
```


---

# Let's start with some simple data

### Break it down first
```r
# let's start with some data

streams <- sf::read_sf("./data/Streams_303_d_.shp")
tm_shape(streams) + tm_lines()
```
### what happened?


---

# More data...

```r
counties <- sf::read_sf("./data/County_Boundaries-_Census.shp")

counties_areas <- sf::st_area(counties)
```
### what happened?

### How would you add the areas back to the sf data.frame?

---

# How would you use your data to "get" ONLY Lancaster County?

---

# Something like this:

### which function are we using, and how does it work?
```r
lc <- counties %>% dplyr::filter(., NAME10 == "Lancaster")
```

---

# How would we find only those 303d streams in Lancaster County?

---

# Something like this:

```r
lc_303ds <- sf::st_intersection(streams, lc)
```

---

# Plot them:

### let's break them down - how are these different?
```r
tm_shape(lc_303ds) + tm_lines()
tm_shape(lc_303ds) + tm_lines(col = "blue")

tm_shape(lc_303ds) + tm_lines(col = "Waterbody_")
```
### What happened?

---

# Buffers

- What's a buffer?

---

# Let's try one

### Break down the code...
```r
buffs <- sf::st_buffer(lc_303ds, dist = 1000)

tm_shape(buffs) + tm_polygons(col = "Waterbody_")
```
### What does it look like?

---

# Point data

```r
# read the state parks shapefile
parks <- sf::read_sf("./data/State_Park_Locations.shp")

# subset to lancaster county
lc_parks <- sf::st_intersection(parks, lc)

# plot them
tm_shape(lc_parks) + tm_dots(col = "AreaName", size = 1)
```

---

# Plotting multiple layers using ```tm```

```r
tm_shape(lc_303ds) + tm_lines(col = "Waterbody_") + 
  tm_shape(lc_parks) + tm_dots(col = "AreaName", size = 1)
```
### What happened?

---

# Your final task

- find all of the state parks within 0.5 miles of a 303d stream
- plot just those points WITH the corresponding stream segment
- use color to distinguish the points and stream segments

## GO!

---

## For this week

- Chapters 5 & 6
- Practice, practice, practice
- Lab 01 due
