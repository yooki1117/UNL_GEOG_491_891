## 

## Week 06.01: A quick discussion on point pattern analysis + bonus

### Dr. Bitterman

##

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Point pattern
- Activity

---

## Anything to discuss? Questions?

---

# Chapter 6 is more extensive and more advanced than we really need to get into

### So we're adapting

---

# today's setup

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(GISTools)
library(sf)
library(tmap)

# data:
#cumulative rainfall for 2008
precip <- sf::read_sf("./data/Precip2008Readings.shp")
neb <- sf::read_sf("./data/Nebraska_State_Boundary.shp")
```
---

# Map the data as we would normally

```r
tm_shape(neb) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(precip) + tm_dots(col='navyblue')
```

---

# A more interactive way to use tmap

```r
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(neb) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(precip) + tm_dots(col='navyblue')
```

---

# Change it back to the standard "plot" view

```
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(neb) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(precip) + tm_dots(col='navyblue')
```

---

# Interpolation

- How does it work?

---

# KDE vs. IDW vs. Kriging

### Jargon, ahoy!

---

# Returning to our task from a few weeks ago:

1. Find your team
2. Make a plan, how are you going to answer the following...

### How large is the harmful algal bloom (HAB) in Missisquoi Bay?

### Which monitoring station(s) could have detected the HAB?

### How much area (in the entire lake) has a CICyano value greater than 0.10?

... only once you have a plan should you start writing code

## For this week

- Chapters 7
- Practice, practice, practice
- Lab 02 - keep working
