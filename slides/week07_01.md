# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Spatial data operations
- Activity

---

## Anything to discuss? Questions?


---

# today's setup

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(GISTools)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

---

# Today's data

```r
counties <- sf::read_sf("./data/CBW/County_Boundaries.shp") %>% sf::st_make_valid()
dams <- sf::read_sf("./data/CBW/Dam_or_Other_Blockage_Removed_2012_2017.shp") %>% sf::st_make_valid()
streams <- sf::read_sf("./data/CBW/Streams_Opened_by_Dam_Removal_2012_2017.shp") %>% sf::st_make_valid()
```

---

# Remind me, how would we find the dams that are in Pennsylvania?

---

# First, let's get the counties in PA

```r
pa.counties <- counties %>% filter(STATEFP10 == 42)
```

---

```subsetting w/ [x,]```

we've done intersection
and also intersects
filter(st_intersects(x = ., y = something else))
sparse argument

st_disjoint
st_within
st_touches
st_is_within_distance

st_join
